\begin{Question}
Can you show that any shrinker has finitely many ends? Can you try to construct certain special functions for each end and argue that there should not be too many such functions?
\end{Question}

\begin{Question}
Can you show that if a shrinker is non-compact and has no volume growth, then the volume growth must be quadratic and it is asymptotic to $\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{R}^2$? 
\end{Question}
These are conjectures by Ovidiu Munteanu and Jiaping Wang, and their works on shrinkers use a lot of a priori estimates.

\begin{Question}
Can you classify $4$-dimensional shrinkers? For now, the $4$-dimensional \textit{K\"ahler} shrinkers have been fully classified. Or, as a partial step, can you classify $4$-dimensional shrinkers with half positive isotropic curvature? This is a conjecture by Richard Hamilton.
\end{Question}



\begin{Question}
Can you define a notion of generic singularities for the Ricci flow? Generalized cylinders are expected to be generic singularities, because Colding and Minicozzi proved the parallel results for the mean curvature flow. More concretely, can you show (even in dimension 3) that after perturbing the initial metric, there will be only cylindrical singularities? 
\end{Question}

\begin{Question}
Yau has a conjecture: If $(M^m,g,J)$ is a complete K\"ahler manifold with positive bisectional curvature, then it must be biholomorphic to $\mathbb{C}^n.$ Gang Liu solved a special case of the  conjecture assuming Euclidean volume growth, i.e., ${\rm Vol}(B(p,r))\ge c r^{2m}$ where $m$ is the complex dimension of $M$. Can you try to solve the remaining case where the volume growth is slower than Euclidean? Or as a partial step, can you construct holomorphic functions $u$ with an exponential linear growth, i.e., $|u|(x)\le e^{Cd(x,p)}$? This is related to Gang Liu's works.
\end{Question}





\section*{Problem 1: Integrable Complex Structure on the Six-Sphere}

\textbf{Statement.}  Does there exist an integrable complex structure on the six-dimensional sphere $S^6$ extending the known almost complex structure induced by octonionic multiplication?  Equivalently, is there a smooth tensor field $J: TS^6\to TS^6$ with $J^2=-\mathrm{Id}$ and vanishing Nijenhuis tensor $N_J$, coinciding (up to orientation) with the standard almost complex structure from imaginary octonions.\\

\textbf{Background.}  The sphere $S^6$ admits an almost complex structure via the octonion algebra, but Newlander--Nirenberg integrability requires $N_J=0$.  No explicit integrable structure has been found, nor has nonexistence been proven.\\

\textbf{Objective.}  To produce an explicit integrable $J$ on $S^6$ or to demonstrate that no such $J$ can exist.\\

\textbf{Current Status.}  Open since work of Ehresmann and Libermann \cite{atiyah2016nonexistentcomplex6sphere}.  Partial obstructions shown by Chern \cite{bryant2021sschernsstudyalmostcomplex, 2018} under certain curvature assumptions.\\


\section*{Problem 2: Inhomogeneous Einstein Metrics on $S^3\times S^3$}

\textbf{Statement.}  Does $S^3\times S^3$ admit a Riemannian metric $g$ with $\mathrm{Ric}(g)=\lambda\,g$ that is not homothetic to the standard product metric or the known nearly K\"ahler metric?\\

\textbf{Background.}  Two homogeneous Einstein metrics exist: the round product and the nearly K\"ahler metric \cite{butruille2006homogeneousnearlykahlermanifolds}.

\textbf{Objective.}  To construct an inhomogeneous Einstein metric on $S^3\times S^3$, or to prove none exist.\\

\textbf{Current Status.}  Open; variational methods have identified critical points on other manifolds but yield no new metrics here.\\

\section*{Problem 3: Existence of a Finite Projective Plane of Order 12}

\textbf{Statement.}  Does there exist a finite projective plane of order $12$?  Finite projective planes are known to exist precisely when the order is a power of a prime; the smallest open case is $12$.\\

\textbf{Background.}  The Bruck--Ryser--Chowla theorem excludes orders $n\equiv1,2\pmod4$ unless $n$ is a sum of two squares; this rules out $6$, $10$ has been ruled out by Lam, Thiel, Swiercz \cite{Lam_Thiel_Swiercz_1989}.  Order $12$ remains open.\\

\textbf{Objective.}  To construct a projective plane of order $12$, or to prove such a plane cannot exist.\\

\textbf{Current Status.}  Extensive computer searches have found none for orders up to $12$.\\

\section*{Problem 4: Inverse Galois Problem over Q}

\textbf{Statement.}  Is every finite group $G$ isomorphic to the Galois group $\mathrm{Gal}(L/\mathbb{Q})$ for some finite extension $L/\mathbb{Q}$?\\

\textbf{Background.}  Shafarevich \cite{vsafarevivc1954construction} solved the case of solvable groups; many simple groups arise via rigidity methods.  A general realization method for arbitrary finite $G$ remains unknown.\\

\textbf{Objective.}  To produce, for any finite group $G$, a polynomial over $\mathbb{Q}$ whose splitting field has Galois group $G$, or to establish an obstruction principle.\\

\textbf{Current Status.}  Open; partial results cover solvable groups and most sporadic simple groups.\\

\section*{Problem 5: Global Regularity for the Three-Dimensional Navier--Stokes Equations}

\textbf{Statement.}  For smooth, divergence-free initial data on $\mathbb{R}^3$, do the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations admit a global smooth solution without singularities at finite time?\\

\textbf{Background.}  In two dimensions, global regularity is proved via vorticity control.  In three dimensions, nonlinear energy cascades may lead to finite-time blowup; only conditional or small-data results are known.\\

\textbf{Objective.}  To establish global existence and smoothness for arbitrary smooth initial data, or to exhibit a finite-time singular solution.\\

\textbf{Current Status.}  Open; partial regularity results by Caffarelli--Kohn--Nirenberg \cite{caffarelli1982partial} show singular set has zero one-dimensional measure.\\
